Write a method that takes a positive integer as an argument and returns that 
number with its digits reversed. 

Examples:

reversed_number(12345) == 54321
reversed_number(12213) == 31221
reversed_number(456) == 654
reversed_number(12000) == 21 # Note that zeros get dropped!
reversed_number(1) == 1

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes an integer as an argument
  return the number with the digits reversed (0's get dropped)

Logic:
  convert the number to a string, call reverse, convert to a number
