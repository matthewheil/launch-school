Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and 
the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two numbers,
except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by 
5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print 
"FizzBuzz".

Example:

fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13,
14, FizzBuzz

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes two numbers as arguments
  the first number is the starting number
  the second number is the ending number
  print out all numbers from the starting number to the ending number
    if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
    if the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead
    if the number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead

Logic:
  create an array that stores all of the numbers ( array =* (start..end) )
  iterate through the numbers
    if div 3 and div 5
      print "FizzBuzz"
    if div 5
      ...
    if div 3
      ...
    else
      print number
  
  create an array
  current = start
  loop
    if ... 
    break if current >= end
    current += 1
