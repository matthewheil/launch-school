Write a method that takes a non-empty string argument, and returns the middle 
character or characters of the argument. If the argument has an odd length, 
you should return exactly one character. If the argument has an even length, 
you should return exactly two characters.

Examples:

center_of('I love ruby') == 'e'
center_of('Launch School') == ' '
center_of('Launch') == 'un'
center_of('Launchschool') == 'hs'
center_of('x') == 'x'

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a non-empty string as an argument
  if the string has an odd length, return the middle char
  else return the middle two chars
  
Logic:
  if odd, string.chars.length/2 is the index of the middle char
  else, string.chars.length/2 is the second of the middle. that one and the one before it
