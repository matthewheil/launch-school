Write a method that takes a string, and returns a new string in which every 
character is doubled.

Examples:

repeater('Hello') == "HHeelllloo"
repeater("Good job!") == "GGoooodd  jjoobb!!"
repeater('') == ''

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a string as an argument
    for the string, double each character
  return the new string

Logic:
  create a new string that is blank
  for each char in string, concat it to the new string * 2
