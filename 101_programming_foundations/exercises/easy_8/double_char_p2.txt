Write a method that takes a string, and returns a new string in which every 
consonant character is doubled. Vowels (a,e,i,o,u), digits, punctuation, 
and whitespace should not be doubled.

Examples:

double_consonants('String') == "SSttrrinngg"
double_consonants("Hello-World!") == "HHellllo-WWorrlldd!"
double_consonants("July 4th") == "JJullyy 4tthh"
double_consonants('') == ""

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a string as an argument
  returns a new string
    new string has doubled consonant characters. all others are not doubled
    
Logic:
  create a constant that is an array of only consonants
  create a new string that is blank
  iterate through the chars in string
    if char.downcase is included in the constant
      concat char * 2
    else
      concat char
