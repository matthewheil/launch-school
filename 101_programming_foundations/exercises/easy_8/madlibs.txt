Mad libs are a simple game where you create a story template with blanks for 
words. You, or another player, then construct a list of words and place them 
into the story, creating an often silly or funny story as a result.

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, 
and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

# Example
# 
# Enter a noun: dog
# Enter a verb: walk
# Enter an adjective: blue
# Enter an adverb: quickly
# 
# Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hilarious!

Understand the problem:

    the method should prompt for a noun, verb, adverb, and adjective
    injects those into a sentence
    prints the sentence
