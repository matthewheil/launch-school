Palindromic Numbers

Write a method that returns true if its integer argument is palindromic, false 
otherwise. A palindromic number reads the same forwards and backwards.

Examples:

palindromic_number?(34543) == true
palindromic_number?(123210) == false
palindromic_number?(22) == true
palindromic_number?(5) == true

understand the problem:
  in the method
    take an integer as an argument
    test if the number is the same forward and backwards

input:
  an integer

output:
  a boolean

logic:
  create the method that takes an integer as the parameter
    convert the integer to a string
      call palindrome? on it
