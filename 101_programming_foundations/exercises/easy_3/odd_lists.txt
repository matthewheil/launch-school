Odd Lists

Write a method that returns an Array that contains every other element of an 
Array that is passed in as an argument. The values in the returned list should 
be those values that are in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on elements of the 
argument Array.

Examples:

oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [2, 4, 6]
oddities(['abc', 'def']) == ['abc']
oddities([123]) == [123]
oddities([]) == []

Understand the problem:
  write a method that takes an array as an argument
  the method returns a new array
  the new array contains the elements from all of the even indices
  
Input:
  an array
  
Output:
  a new array containing the elements from the inputs even indices
  
Logic:
  make a new array
  make a count
  iterate the array incrementing the count and append to the new array
  if the count is even
