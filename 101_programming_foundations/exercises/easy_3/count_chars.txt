Counting the Number of Characters

Write a program that will ask a user for an input of a word or multiple words 
and give back the number of characters. Spaces should not be counted as a 
character.


Examples:
  input:  Please write word or multiple words: walk
  output:  There are 4 characters in "walk".
  
  input:  Please write word or multiple words: walk, don't run
  output:  There are 13 characters in "walk, don't run". 
  
Understand the problem:
  given a string of one or more words, display the number of characters in 
  those words. do not count spaces.
  
Input:
  a string containing one or more words
  
Output:

Logic:

  create var counted_chars = given string split, joined(no space), .chars, count
  display the counted_chars in the given string
