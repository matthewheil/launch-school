Using the multiply method from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a 
method that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of 
multiplying a number by itself).

Example:

square(5) == 25
square(-8) == 64

Understand the problem:
  using the multiply method from the previous exercise, write a method that 
  returns the square of the argument
  
Input:
  a number
  
Output:
  the square of that number
  
Logic:
  write a square method that takes a number as an argument
    calls multiply and passes the number as both parameters
