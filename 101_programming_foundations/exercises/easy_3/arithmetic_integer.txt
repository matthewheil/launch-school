Write a program that prompts the user for two positive integers, 
and then prints the results of the following operations on those two numbers: 
addition, subtraction, product, quotient, remainder, and power. 
Do not worry about validating the input.

Example:
  ==> Enter the first number:
  23
  ==> Enter the second number:
  17
  ==> 23 + 17 = 40
  ==> 23 - 17 = 6
  ==> 23 * 17 = 391
  ==> 23 / 17 = 1
  ==> 23 % 17 = 6
  ==> 23 ** 17 = 141050039560662968926103
  
Understand the problem:
  prompt the user for a first number
  prompt the user for a second number
  display the result of performing the following operations on the two numbers:
    addition
    subtraction
    product
    quotient
    remainder
    power
    
Input:
  two numbers

Output:
  displayed results of all performed operations
  
Logic
  Prompt the user for numbers and store in variables
  store the operators in an array as symbols
  loop through the operations and display the results like in the example
