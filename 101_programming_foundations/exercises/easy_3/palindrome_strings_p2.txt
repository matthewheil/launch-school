Palindromic Strings (Part 2)

Write another method that returns true if the string passed as an argument is a 
palindrome, false otherwise. This time, however, your method should be 
case-insensitive, and it should ignore all non-alphanumeric characters. If you 
wish, you may simplify things by calling the palindrome? method you wrote in the 
previous exercise.

Examples:

real_palindrome?('madam') == true
real_palindrome?('Madam') == true           # (case does not matter)
real_palindrome?("Madam, I'm Adam") == true # (only alphanumerics matter)
real_palindrome?('356653') == true
real_palindrome?('356a653') == true
real_palindrome?('123ab321') == false

understand the problem:
  create another method that takes a string as input
  return true if the string is a palindrome
    ignore non-alphanumeric characters and capitalization
  otherwise return false
  call the palindrome method from exercise 1
  
input:
  a string
  
output:
  boolean
  
logic:
  create a variable that is an array of all lowercase letters
  downcase the string
    split the string 
    select all elements that are part of the letters array
    join the string and store in variable
  call the palindrome method with this new variable
