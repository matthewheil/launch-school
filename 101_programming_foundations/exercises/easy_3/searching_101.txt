Write a program that solicits 6 numbers from the user, then prints a message 
that describes whether or not the 6th number appears amongst the first 5 
numbers.

Examples:

==> Enter the 1st number:
25
==> Enter the 2nd number:
15
==> Enter the 3rd number:
20
==> Enter the 4th number:
17
==> Enter the 5th number:
23
==> Enter the last number:
17
The number 17 appears in [25, 15, 20, 17, 23].


==> Enter the 1st number:
25
==> Enter the 2nd number:
15
==> Enter the 3rd number:
20
==> Enter the 4th number:
17
==> Enter the 5th number:
23
==> Enter the last number:
18
The number 18 does not appear in [25, 15, 20, 17, 23].

Understand the problem:
  prompt the user for a number 6 times and store those numbers in an array
  display to the user if the 6th number appears in the first 5 numbers given
  
Input:
  an integer (6 times)
  
Output:
  whether the 6th integer is found in the first 5 entered
  the 6th integer entered
  the array of integers
  
Logic:
  Make a method that gets the numbers from the user and returns the array of #'s
    use a loop that prompts for a number and verifies
  Make a method for verifying that the numbers are integers
  Make a method for seeing if the last number in an array is included in first 5
    array.first(5).include?(array.last)
  Do an if/else to display to the user the results
