What Century is That?

Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. The return 
value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with st, 
nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.

New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise 
the 20th century.

Examples:

century(2000) == '20th'
century(2001) == '21st'
century(1965) == '20th'
century(256) == '3rd'
century(5) == '1st'
century(10103) == '102nd'
century(1052) == '11th'
century(1127) == '12th'
century(11201) == '113th'

Understand the problem:
  write a method that takes a year as input
  return a string with the century that year is in
    make sure it ends with the appropriate st, nd, rd, or th for that number


Input:
  a year
  
Output:
  what century that year is in

Logic:
  divide the year by 100 and add 1 for the century number
  create a case statement that uses the century number
    ends in 1 is 1st except for 11th
    ends in 2 is 2nd except for 12th
    ends in 3 is 3rd except for 13th
    ends in 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 ends in th
  does the century end in 11, 12, or 13? use th
    century.chars[-2, 2].join could work
