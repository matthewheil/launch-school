In the previous two exercises, you developed methods that convert simple numeric 
strings to signed Integers. In this exercise and the next, you're going to 
reverse those methods.

Write a method that takes a positive integer or zero, and converts it to a 
string representation.

You may not use any of the standard conversion methods available in Ruby, 
such as Integer#to_s, String(), Kernel#format, etc. Your method should do 
this the old-fashioned way and construct the string by analyzing and 
manipulating the number.

Examples

integer_to_string(4321) == '4321'
integer_to_string(0) == '0'
integer_to_string(5000) == '5000'

understand the problem:
  take an integer 0 or greater as an argument
  turn that integer into a string

input:
  0 or a positive integer

output:
  a string of digits representing the input number
  
logic:
  use divmod to get each digit, compare the remainder to an array that maps to 
  the string version of the digit and append to string result
  loop divmod until result is 0
