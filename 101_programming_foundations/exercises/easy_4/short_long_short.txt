Short Long Short

Write a method that takes two strings as arguments, determines the longest of 
the two strings, and then returns the result of concatenating the shorter 
string, the longer string, and the shorter string once again. You may assume 
that the strings are of different lengths.

Examples:

short_long_short('abc', 'defgh') == "abcdefghabc"
short_long_short('abcde', 'fgh') == "fghabcdefgh"
short_long_short('', 'xyz') == "xyz"

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes two strings as arguments
  return a result that is the shorter string + longer string + shorter string
  what if both string sizes are the same?
    will display a message that the two strings are the same size (returning nil)
  
Input:
  two strings
  
Output:
  one string that combines shorter string + longer string + shorter string
  
Logic:
  compare the sizes of the two strings
  if the first string is longer
    2nd string + first string + 2nd string
  if the 2nd string is longer
    1st string + 2nd string + 1st string
