Running Totals

Write a method that takes an Array of numbers, and returns an Array with the 
same number of elements, and each element has the running total from the 
original Array.

Examples:

running_total([2, 5, 13]) == [2, 7, 20]
running_total([14, 11, 7, 15, 20]) == [14, 25, 32, 47, 67]
running_total([3]) == [3]
running_total([]) == []

understand the problem:
  create a method that takes an array of numbers as an argument
  return a new array
    the array should have the same number of elements as the original array
    the elements in the new array should be the running total from the original array

input:
  array of numbers
  
output:
  a new array of same size with elements that are running totals

logic:
  create a variable for running_total
  map the array and return in the block the running total
    the running total will be running_total += element
  the map block return should be the method return
