Write a method that takes a positive integer, n, as an argument, and displays a 
right triangle whose sides each have n stars. The hypotenuse of the triangle 
(the diagonal side in the images below) should have one end at the lower-left 
of the triangle, and the other end at the upper-right.

Examples:

triangle(5)

    *
   **
  ***
 ****
*****
triangle(9)

        *
       **
      ***
     ****
    *****
   ******
  *******
 ********
*********

Understand the problem:
  Create a method that takes a positive integer as input.
  Outputs a right triangle made of *'s

Input:
  a positive integer

Output:
  a right triangle made of *'s

Logic:
  n = positive integer as input
  output will have n lines
  x = n - 1
  loop
    line will x spaces and n - x *'s
    break if x == 0
    x -= 1
  end
  first line will be x spaces and n - x *'s
  the last line will be n *'s
