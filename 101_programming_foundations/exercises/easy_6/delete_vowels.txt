Delete vowels

Write a method that takes an array of strings, and returns an array of the same 
string values, except with the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) removed.

Example:

remove_vowels(%w(abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)) == %w(bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxyz)
remove_vowels(%w(green YELLOW black white)) == %w(grn YLLW blck wht)
remove_vowels(%w(ABC AEIOU XYZ)) == ['BC', '', 'XYZ']

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes an array of strings as an argument
  remove all of the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from the array
  return the array with the vowels removed

Input:
  an array

Output:
  an array

Logic:
  receive an array with vowels
  delete all elements in the array that are vowels
  return this modified array
