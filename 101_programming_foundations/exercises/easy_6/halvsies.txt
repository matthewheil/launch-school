Halvsies

Write a method that takes an Array as an argument, and returns two Arrays 
that contain the first half and second half of the original Array, 
respectively. If the original array contains an odd number of elements, 
the middle element should be placed in the first half Array.

Examples:

halvsies([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
halvsies([1, 5, 2, 4, 3]) == [[1, 5, 2], [4, 3]]
halvsies([5]) == [[5], []]
halvsies([]) == [[], []]

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes an array as an argument
  return two arrays 
    the first array is the first half of the array argument
    the second array is the second half of the array argument
    if the array argument is odd
      the middle element should be placed in the first array

Input:
  an array

Output:
  two arrays

Logic:
  1st array
  2nd array
  given array.size
  count = 0
  if array.size is even
      while count <= size/2
        1st array[count] = array[count]
        count+1
      end
      while count <= size
        2nd array[count] = array[count]
        count+1
      end
    else
      while count <= size/2 + 1
      1st array[count] = array[count]
        count+1
      end
      while count <= size
        2nd array[count] = array[count]
        count+1
      end
    end
  end
return [arr1, arr2]
