Does My List Include This?

Write a method named include? that takes an Array and a search value as 
arguments. This method should return true if the search value is in the array, 
false if it is not. You may not use the Array#include? method in your solution.

include?([1,2,3,4,5], 3) == true
include?([1,2,3,4,5], 6) == false
include?([], 3) == false
include?([nil], nil) == true
include?([], nil) == false

Understand the problem:
  given an array and a search value, return true if the search value is in the 
  array and false if it is not. Cannot use Array#include? method.

Input:
  an array and a search value

Output:
  true if the search value is in the array
  false if it is not

Logic:
  assign the first element to a new array
  count = 1
  using a loop
    return true if find on the new array using arg_array[count]
    count += 1
    break if count >= arg_array.size
  false
