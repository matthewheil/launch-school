Combining Arrays

Write a method that takes two Arrays as arguments, and returns an Array that 
contains all of the values from the argument Arrays. There should be no 
duplication of values in the returned Array, even if there are duplicates in 
the original Arrays.

Example

merge([1, 3, 5], [3, 6, 9]) == [1, 3, 5, 6, 9]

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes two arrays as arguments.
  combine the arrays
  remove any duplicates

Input:
  two arrays
  
Output:
  one array with duplicates removed

Logic:
  Combine the arrays
  Remove duplicates
  Return the new array
