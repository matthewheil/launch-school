Write a method that takes one argument, a positive integer, and returns a string
of alternating 1s and 0s, always starting with 1. The length of the string should
match the given integer.

Understanding the Problem:
  given a number, create a string of 1s and 0s, always starting with 1
  the length of the string should be equal to the number given

Test Cases:
  puts stringy(6) == '101010'
  puts stringy(9) == '101010101'
  puts stringy(4) == '1010'
  puts stringy(7) == '1010101'
  ** no validation on input -- assume positive integers **
  * Do I need to handle edge cases?
  * Should I handle errors and raise exceptions?

Input:
  positive integer

Output:
  string
  starts with 1
  alternates 1s and 0s
  length is the passed integer
  no spaces or punctuation
          
Logic:
  set count to 1 outside the loop
  set string to ''
  make a loop that iterates based on passed integer
  inside the loop
    if the count is odd, append a 1 to string variable
    if the count is even, append a 0 to string variable
    increment count by 1
  loop while count <= number passed
  returns string
