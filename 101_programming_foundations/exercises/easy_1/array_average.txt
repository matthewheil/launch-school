Write a method that takes one argument, an array containing integers, and 
returns the average of all numbers in the array. The array will never be empty 
and the numbers will always be positive integers.

Understanding the problem:
  method that takes only one argument
  argument is an array of positive integers
  returns the average of all numbers in the array
  
Test Cases:
  puts average([1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8]) == 25
  puts average([9, 47, 23, 95, 16, 52]) == 40
  
Input:
  an array
  contents of array are positive integers
  
Output:
  an integer
  integer is the average of all numbers in the array (rounded down)
  
Logic:
  create a sum variable = 0
  array.each
    sum += element value
  return sum / array.size
