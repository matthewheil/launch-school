Create a simple tip calculator. The program should prompt for a bill amount 
and a tip rate. The program must compute the tip and then display both the tip 
and the total amount of the bill.

Understand the problem:
  create a program that prompts the user for two things: bill amount & tip rate
  calculates the tip
  display the tip and total amount of the bill to the user
  
Example:
  What is the bill? 200
  What is the tip percentage? 15
  
  The tip is $30.0
  The total is $230.0
  
Input:
  positive number for bill amount
  positive number for tip percentage
  
Output:
  Dollar amount (2 decimal places) for tip
  Dollar amount (2 decimal places) for total bill
  
Logic:
  prompt the user for the bill amount
  capture into variable as a float
  
  prompt the user for the tip percentage
  capture into variable as a float
  
  capture calculated tip (bill x (tip percentage / 100)) in variable with 2 decimals
  total = tip amount + bill with 2 decimals
  
  display tip amount
  display total
