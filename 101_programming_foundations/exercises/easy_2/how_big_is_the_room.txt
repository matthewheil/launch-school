Build a program that asks a user for the length and width of a room in meters 
and then displays the area of the room in both square meters and square feet.

Understand the problem:
  prompt the user for two numbers: length & width in meters
  calculate two values: square meters and square feet
    (one square meter == 10.7639 square feet)
  display both calculated values to the user
  
Example run:
  Enter the length of the room in meters:
  10
  Enter the width of the room in meters:
  7
  The area of the room is 70.0 square meters (753.47 square feet).
  
Logic:
  variable for length
  variable for width
  var for area meters
  var for area feet
  get lenght & width from user in meters
  calculate area in meters and feet
  display results to user
