Write a program that will ask for user's name. The program will then greet the 
user. If the user writes "name!" then the computer yells back to the user.

Examples:

  What is your name? Bob
  Hello Bob.
  What is your name? Bob!
  HELLO BOB. WHY ARE WE SCREAMING?
  
Understand the problem:
  prompt a user for their name
  greet them normally unless they put a !
    then greet them with all caps
  (assuming no validation on input from user)

Input:
  name
  
Output:
  one of two greetings
    normal greeting 
    all caps greeting (if name!)
    
Logic:
  ask user for their name
  store in variable
  
  if name.chars.last == '!'
    remove ! from name
    greet with all caps
  else
    greet normally
