Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 0, then 
asks if the user wants to determine the sum or product of all numbers between 
1 and the entered integer.

Examples:
  >> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
  5
  >> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product.
  s
  The sum of the integers between 1 and 5 is 15.
  
  
  >> Please enter an integer greater than 0:
  6
  >> Enter 's' to compute the sum, 'p' to compute the product.
  p
  The product of the integers between 1 and 6 is 720.
  
Understand the problem:
  ask the user for a number greater than 0
  ask if the user wants the sum or product
  calculate either the sum or product of all numbers from 1 to the number entered
  display the result to the user
  
Input:
  an integer greater than 0
  a choice: sum or product
  
Output:
  if choice is sum, the sum of numbers from 1 to the entered number
  if choice is product, the product of numbers from 1 to the entered number
  
Logic
  prompt user for integer greater than 0
  store in variable
  
  prompt user for choice of sum or product
  store in variable
  
  create variable for result
  
  if choice is sum
    number.times do |number|
      result += (number + 1)
    end
  else (choice is product)
    number.times do |number|
      result *= (number + 1)
    end
  end
  
  display result
