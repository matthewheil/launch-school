Letter Counter (Part 2)

Modify the word_sizes method from the previous exercise to exclude non-letters 
when determining word size. For instance, the length of "it's" is 3, not 4.

Examples

word_sizes('Four score and seven.') == { 3 => 1, 4 => 1, 5 => 2 }
word_sizes('Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle!') == { 3 => 5, 6 => 3 }
word_sizes("What's up doc?") == { 5 => 1, 2 => 1, 3 => 1 }
word_sizes('') == {}

Understand the problem:
  Modify the method from p1 so that it does not count non-alpha characters in
  the word size.

Input:
  String

Output:
  Hash

Logic:
  Take a string a break it up into words (split)
  For each word, count the alphabetic characters ("a-zA-Z")
  Increment the key for word.size
  Return hash
