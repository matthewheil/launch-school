Letter Counter (Part 1)

Write a method that takes a string with one or more space separated words and 
returns a hash that shows the number of words of different sizes.

Words consist of any string of characters that do not include a space.

Examples

word_sizes('Four score and seven.') == { 3 => 1, 4 => 1, 5 => 1, 6 => 1 }
word_sizes('Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle!') == { 3 => 5, 6 => 1, 7 => 2 }
word_sizes("What's up doc?") == { 6 => 1, 2 => 1, 4 => 1 }
word_sizes('') == {}

Understand the problem:
  Create a method that takes a string as an argument.
  The string can be one or more words separated by a space.
  A word is any string of characters that do not include a space.
  The method returns a hash:
    The keys are the length of a word in the string
    The values are the occurences for those lengths

Input:
  A string

Output:
  A hash

Logic:
  Take the string and separate the words.
  For each word, see how big it is(size)
  If that size does not exist in the hash, add it to the hash
  If that size does exist, increment that size by 1
  Return the hash
  Can use each with object
