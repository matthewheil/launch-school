ddaaiillyy ddoouubbllee

Write a method that takes a string argument and returns a new string that 
contains the value of the original string with all consecutive duplicate 
characters collapsed into a single character. You may not use String#squeeze or 
String#squeeze!.

Examples:

crunch('ddaaiillyy ddoouubbllee') == 'daily double'
crunch('4444abcabccba') == '4abcabcba'
crunch('ggggggggggggggg') == 'g'
crunch('a') == 'a'
crunch('') == ''

Understand the problem:
  Create a method that takes a string as an argument
  Reduce consecutive alphabetic characters to one instance
  Return the new string

Input:
  A string

Output:
  A string

Logic:
  create a new string array
  create a new word array
  split the string into words
  for each word, split the word into characters
    for each character, compare to the last character in new word array
      if same, next
      else append to array
  append the joined new word array to the new string array
  return the new string array joined
