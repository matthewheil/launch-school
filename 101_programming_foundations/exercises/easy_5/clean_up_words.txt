Clean up the words

Given a string that consists of some words and an assortment of non-alphabetic 
characters, write a method that returns that string with all of the 
non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. If one or more non-alphabetic 
characters occur in a row, you should only have one space in the result (the 
result should never have consecutive spaces).

Examples:

cleanup("---what's my +*& line?") == ' what s my line '

Understand the problem:
  Create a method that takes a string as an argument.
  Replace any special characters with a space and only one space per grouping
  of special characters.
  
Input:
  A string with non-alphabetic characters

Output:
  The string with any non-alphabetic characters removed.
  A single space should occupy each grouping of non-alphabetic characters

Logic:
  gsub the string, matching a regexp for non-alphabetic characters with a space
