Letter Swap

Given a string of words separated by spaces, write a method that takes this 
string of words and returns a string in which the first and last letters of 
every word is swapped.

You may assume that every word contains at least one letter, and that the 
string will always contain at least one word. You may also assume that each 
string contains nothing but words and spaces

Examples:

swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is') == 'hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si'
swap('Abcde') == 'ebcdA'
swap('a') == 'a'

Understand the problem:
  Create a method that takes a string of at least one word as an argument.
  The method returns that string with the first and last letters swapped for 
  every word in that string.

Input:
  A string of at least one word. Words are separated by spaces. Each string
  contains only words and spaces.

Output:
  The string where each word has its first and last letters swapped.

Logic:
  Split the string based on spaces.
  Map the array.
    Store the first letter of the word.
    Set the first letter of the word equal to the last letter of the word.
    Set the last letter of the word based on the stored first letter.
