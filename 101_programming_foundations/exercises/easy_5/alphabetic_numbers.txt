Alphabetical Numbers

Write a method that takes an Array of Integers between 0 and 19, and returns an 
Array of those Integers sorted based on the English words for each number:

zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, 
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen

Examples:

alphabetic_number_sort((0..19).to_a) == [
  8, 18, 11, 15, 5, 4, 14, 9, 19, 1, 7, 17,
  6, 16, 10, 13, 3, 12, 2, 0
]

Understand the problem:
  Create a method that takes an array of integers between 0 and 19 as an argument
  Sorts the numbers in the array based on the english word for each number.
  Returns the sorted array.

Input:
  An array integers

Output:
  An array of integers

Logic:
  Take the array of integers
  Convert the integers to their english word
  Sort the array based on alphabet
  Convert the english word into integers
  Return the array
    Use a hash that maps the integer to the english word
