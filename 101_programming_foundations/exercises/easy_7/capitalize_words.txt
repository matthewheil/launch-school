Write a method that takes a single String argument and returns a new string 
that contains the original value of the argument with the first character of 
every word capitalized and all other letters lowercase.

You may assume that words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

Examples

word_cap('four score and seven') == 'Four Score And Seven'
word_cap('the javaScript language') == 'The Javascript Language'
word_cap('this is a "quoted" word') == 'This Is A "quoted" Word'

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a string as an argument
  the method returns the string where the first character of every word is
  capitalized and all others are lowercase

Input:
  a string

Output:
  a string

Logic:
  split the string
  iterate over the words
    for each word
    do character assignment for the first letter as capitalized
  return the string
