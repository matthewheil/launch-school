Write a method that takes an Array of integers as input, multiplies all the 
numbers together, divides the result by the number of entries in the Array, 
and then prints the result rounded to 3 decimal places. Assume the array is 
non-empty.

Examples:

show_multiplicative_average([3, 5])
The result is 7.500

show_multiplicative_average([6])
The result is 6.000

show_multiplicative_average([2, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17])
The result is 28361.667

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes an array of integers as input
  multiply the integers together then divide the result by the number of entries
  in the array. print the result rounded to 3 decimal places.

Input:
  an array

Output:
  a float

Logic:
  reduce the array using multiplication
  divide that by the size of the array
  print the result using 3 decimal places
