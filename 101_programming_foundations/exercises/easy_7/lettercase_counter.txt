Write a method that takes a string, and then returns a hash that contains 3 
entries: one represents the number of characters in the string that are 
lowercase letters, one the number of characters that are uppercase letters, 
and one the number of characters that are neither.

Examples

letter_case_count('abCdef 123') == { lowercase: 5, uppercase: 1, neither: 4 }
letter_case_count('AbCd +Ef') == { lowercase: 3, uppercase: 3, neither: 2 }
letter_case_count('123') == { lowercase: 0, uppercase: 0, neither: 3 }
letter_case_count('') == { lowercase: 0, uppercase: 0, neither: 0 }

Understand the problem: 
  Create a method that takes a string as an argument
  the method returns a hash with three keys:
    the number of lowercase letters in the string
    the number of uppercase letters in the string
    the number of characters that are neither

Input:
  a string

Output:
  a hash

Logic:
  create two constants, all lowercase letters and all uppercase letters
  iterate through the string and 
  compare against all lowercase
    if matched, increment the first key
  compare against all uppercase
    matched, increment the 2nd key
  neither
    increment the third key
  return the hash
