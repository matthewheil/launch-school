Write a method that takes two Array arguments in which each Array contains a 
list of numbers, and returns a new Array that contains the product of each pair
of numbers from the arguments that have the same index. You may assume that the 
arguments contain the same number of elements.

Examples:

multiply_list([3, 5, 7], [9, 10, 11]) == [27, 50, 77]

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes two arrays of numbers (of the same size) as arguments
  return a new array whose elements are the product of the elements at the same index
  the the original two arrays

Input:
  two arrays

Output:
  one array

Logic:
  create a result array
  count = 0
  loop
    result << arr1[count] * arr2[count]
    break if count >= arr1.size
    increment count
  return result
