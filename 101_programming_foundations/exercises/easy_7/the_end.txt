Write a method that returns the next to last word in the String passed to it as 
an argument.

Words are any sequence of non-blank characters.

You may assume that the input String will always contain at least two words.

Examples:

penultimate('last word') == 'last'
penultimate('Launch School is great!') == 'is'

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a string of at least two words as arguments
    words are any sequence of non-blank characters
  return the second to last word in the string

input:
  a string

output:
  a string

Logic:
  split the string and return the -2 element
  
Extra
Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a string of words as an argument
  return the word in the middle

input:
  a string

output:
  a string

Logic:
 split the string into an array
 if the array size is greater than 1, reference the [arr.size/2] element
 if the array size is 1, return arr[0]
 else return that the string is empty
  an even number of words will return the element to the right
