Write a method that takes a String as an argument, and returns a new String
that contains the original value using a staggered capitalization scheme in 
which every other character is capitalized, and the remaining characters are 
lowercase. Characters that are not letters should not be changed, but count as 
characters when switching between upper and lowercase.

Example:

staggered_case('I Love Launch School!') == 'I LoVe lAuNcH ScHoOl!'
staggered_case('ALL_CAPS') == 'AlL_CaPs'
staggered_case('ignore 77 the 444 numbers') == 'IgNoRe 77 ThE 444 NuMbErS'

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a string as an argument
  iterate through the string and capitalize every other letter, making the ones
  in between lowercase. count non-letter characters when switching between upper
  and lower

Input:
  a string

Output:
  a string

Logic:
  set count to 0
  break the string up into an array of characters and assign a variable
  loop
  case count
  when even capitalize array[count] if its a letter
  when odd downcase array[count] if its a letter
  break if count >= array.size
  count += 1
  end
  join the characters
