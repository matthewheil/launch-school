Write a method that takes a string as an argument and returns a new string in 
which every uppercase letter is replaced by its lowercase version, and every 
lowercase letter by its uppercase version. All other characters should be 
unchanged.

You may not use String#swapcase; write your own version of this method.

Example:

swapcase('CamelCase') == 'cAMELcASE'
swapcase('Tonight on XYZ-TV') == 'tONIGHT ON xyz-tv'

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a string as an argument
  return the string where the characters that were uppercase are now lowercase
  and vice versa

Input:
  a string

Output:
  a string

Logic:
  create two constants: uppercase letters, lowercase letters
  iterate throught the words of the string
  for each word, map the characters
    compare the character with uppercase, swap if true
    otherwise compare the character with lowercase, swap if true
    else return the character
  return the joined words
