Combine Two Lists

Write a method that combines two Arrays passed in as arguments, and returns a 
new Array that contains all elements from both Array arguments, with the 
elements taken in alternation.

You may assume that both input Arrays are non-empty, and that they have the 
same number of elements.

Example:

interleave([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c']) == [1, 'a', 2, 'b', 3, 'c']

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes two arrays as arguments
  combine the arrays interleaving the elements into the new array
  assume the input arrays are non-empty and have the same size

Input:
  two arrays that are non-empty and equal in size

Output:
  one array that is a combination of the two input arrays
  the output array should have alternating elements from each input array

Logic:
  new_array = []
  count = 0
  loop do
    new_array << input_arr1[count]
    new_array << input_arr2[count]
    count += 1
    break if count >= input_arr1.size
  end
