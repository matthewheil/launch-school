Write a method that takes a sentence string as input, and returns the same 
string with any sequence of the words 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 
'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine' converted to a string of digits.

Example:

word_to_digit('Please call me at five five five one two three four. Thanks.') == 'Please call me at 5 5 5 1 2 3 4. Thanks.'

understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a string as an argument
  return the same string that uses digits instead of words for the numbers

logic:
  create a constant (hash) that maps the english word as a key to the digit as a value
  you can map the array of words and join the return
    for the transformation
      if the constant.keys includes the word then return the constant[key] value
      else return the word
