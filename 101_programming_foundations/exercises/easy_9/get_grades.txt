Write a method that determines the mean (average) of the three scores passed 
to it, and returns the letter value associated with that grade.

Numerical Score Letter	Grade
90 <= score <= 100	'A'
80 <= score < 90	'B'
70 <= score < 80	'C'
60 <= score < 70	'D'
0 <= score < 60	'F'

Tested values are all between 0 and 100. There is no need to check for negative 
values or values greater than 100.

Example:

get_grade(95, 90, 93) == "A"
get_grade(50, 50, 95) == "D"

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes three numbers as arguments
    find the mean (average)
  return a letter grade associated with the average

Logic:
  find the average
  create a case that returns the letter based on the score
