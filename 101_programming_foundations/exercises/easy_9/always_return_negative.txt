Write a method that takes a number as an argument. If the argument is a 
positive number, return the negative of that number. If the number is 0 or 
negative, return the original number.

Examples;

negative(5) == -5
negative(-3) == -3
negative(0) == 0      # There's no such thing as -0 in ruby

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a number as an argument
  if the argument is a positive number, return the negative of that number
  if the number is negative or 0, return the original number

Logic:
  if the number > 0 then return number * -1
  else return number
