Write a method which takes a grocery list (array) of fruits with quantities 
and converts it into an array of the correct number of each fruit.

Example:

buy_fruit([["apples", 3], ["orange", 1], ["bananas", 2]]) ==
  ["apples", "apples", "apples", "orange", "bananas","bananas"]
  
Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes an array as an argument
    the array contains sub arrays
      each sub array is a fruit with quantities
  return an array that has the fruit names listed "quantities" times

Logic:
  create a new array
  iterate the array for each element
    sub_array[1].times do
      new_array << sub_array[0]
  return new_array
