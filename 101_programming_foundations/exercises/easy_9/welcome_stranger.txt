Create a method that takes 2 arguments, an array and a hash. The array will 
contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, will 
produce a person's name. The hash will contain two keys, :title and :occupation,
and the appropriate values. Your method should return a greeting that uses the 
person's full name, and mentions the person's title.

Example:

greetings(['John', 'Q', 'Doe'], { title: 'Master', occupation: 'Plumber' })
=> Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around.

understand the problem:
  create a method that takes two arguments, an array and a hash
    the array will have two or more elements in it
    the hash will have two keys, :title and :occupation
  return a greeting using the persons name, title, and occupation

Logic:
  return the greeting with string interpolation
    join the array using a space
    reference the keys for the hash
