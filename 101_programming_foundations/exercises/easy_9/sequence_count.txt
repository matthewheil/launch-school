Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. The first argument is a 
count, and the second is the first number of a sequence that your method will 
create. The method should return an Array that contains the same number of 
elements as the count argument, while the values of each element will be 
multiples of the starting number.

You may assume that the count argument will always have a value of 0 or greater, 
while the starting number can be any integer value. If the count is 0, an empty 
list should be returned.

Examples:

sequence(5, 1) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
sequence(4, -7) == [-7, -14, -21, -28]
sequence(3, 0) == [0, 0, 0]
sequence(0, 1000000) == []

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes two integers as arguments
    the first number is a count
    the second number is part of a sequence
      the sequence is the 2nd number count times and the values will be
      multiples of the starting number

Logic:
  create an empty array
  multiplier = 1
  count.times do
    array << num * multiplier
    multiplier += 1
  return array
