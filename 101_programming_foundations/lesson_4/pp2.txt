Add up all of the ages from the Munster family hash:

ages = { 
        "Herman" => 32, 
        "Lily" => 30, 
        "Grandpa" => 5843, 
        "Eddie" => 10, 
        "Marilyn" => 22, 
        "Spot" => 237 }
        
Understand the problem:
  given a hash, add up all of the values
  
Input:
  hash with keys for names and values are ages
  
Output:
  a sum of all of the values (ages)
  
Logic
  reduce or inject the values of the hash with the + operator
