Given the array below

flintstones = ["Fred", "Barney", "Wilma", "Betty", "Pebbles", "BamBam"]

Turn this array into a hash where the names are the keys and the values are the 
positions in the array.

Understand the problem:
  given an array, create a hash so that:
    the elements in the array are the keys
    the index of those elements is the values

Example:
  ['a', 'b', 'c']
  
  => { 'a' => 0, 'b' => 1, 'c' => 2 }

Input:
  an array
  
Output:
  a hash:
    key is the element of the array
    value is the index of that element
    
Logic:
  create an empty hash
  iterate through the array with index
  assign hash[element] = index
  display the hash
