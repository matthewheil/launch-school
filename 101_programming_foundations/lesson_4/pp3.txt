Practice Problem 3

In the age hash:

ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }

throw out the really old people (age 100 or older).

Understand the problem:
  given a hash of names: ages, delete the key/value pairs of anyone 100 or older
  
Input:
  a hash with age values
  
Output:
  the same hash that has the entry for anyone 100 or older deleted
  
Logic:
  iterate through the hash and keep if age < 100
