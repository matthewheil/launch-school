Amend this array so that the names are all shortened to just the first three 
characters:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)

Understand the problem:
  given an array of names, mutate the array so that the names are shortened to
  just the first three characters
  
Input:
  an array of names
  
Output:
  the same array with the names shortened to the first three characters
  
Logic:
  map! the array and do the following block for each element
    element = element[0, 3]
