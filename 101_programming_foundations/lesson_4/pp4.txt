Practice Problem 4

Pick out the minimum age from our current Munster family hash:

ages = { 
        "Herman" => 32, 
        "Lily" => 30, 
        "Grandpa" => 5843, 
        "Eddie" => 10, 
        "Marilyn" => 22, 
        "Spot" => 237 }

Understand the problem:
  given a hash of names: ages, display the youngest age
  
Input:
  a hash with value of ages
  
Output:
  the youngest age in the values
  
Logic:
  hash.values.min
