As we have seen previously we can use some built-in string methods to change the
case of a string. A notably missing method is something provided in Rails, but 
not in Ruby itself...titleize. This method in Ruby on Rails creates a string 
that has each word capitalized as it would be in a title. For example, the 
string:

words = "the flintstones rock"
would be:

words = "The Flintstones Rock"

Write your own version of the rails titleize implementation.

Understand the problem:
  given a string, capitalize the first letter of every word
  
Input:
  a string of 1 or more words
  
Output:
  a new string with the first letter of every word capitalized
  
Logic:
  split the string into an array
  map the array and do capitalize on each word
  join the array back into a string
  return the string
