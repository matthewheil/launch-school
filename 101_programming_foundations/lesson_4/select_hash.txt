Let's now take a look at an example with hashes. In this example we want to 
select the key-value pairs where the value is 'Fruit'.

  produce = {
    'apple' => 'Fruit',
    'carrot' => 'Vegetable',
    'pear' => 'Fruit',
    'broccoli' => 'Vegetable'
  }

select_fruit(produce) # => {"apple"=>"Fruit", "pear"=>"Fruit"}

How would you implement a method like this?

Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes a hash and returns a new hash with only the
  key-value pairs that have a value of "Fruit"
  has to use a loop do
  
Input:
  a hash

Output:
  a new hash that has key-value pairs where value is Fruit from input hash
  
Logic:
  create a method accepting a hash
    create a variable for the new hash
    create a variable that is an array of the keys
    create a counter set to 0
    
    loop
      break if the keys is empty
      if hash[keys[counter]] == "Fruit" then append it to new hash
      increment counter
      break if counter > keys_array.size
    end
    
    return new hash
