Understand the problem:
  write a method that accepts an array of numbers and doubles the numbers in the 
  array in place
  
Ex:
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  double_numbers!(numbers) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
  
Input:
  an array of numbers
  
Output:
  the same array but with numbers doubled
  
Logic:
  def method accepting numbers
  count = 0
  loop
    break if count == numbers.size
    for the element in numbers at count, double it in place
      numbers[count] = numbers[count] * 2
    count += 1
  end
  return numbers
