Understand the problem:
  create a method that takes no argument
  the method creates 32 hexadecimal characters randomly
  the 32 random characters are separated into 5 sections
  with the each section containing 8-4-4-4-12 characters
  
Input:
  none

Output:
  a string

Logic:
  make an empty string
  make a methods that returns a string of random hex characters
    have it take an argument for how long the string should be
  append the return of the called method to the string and concat dashes between
  calls
